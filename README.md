# pong
The classic game implemented with C++ and SFML.

# Instructions
Very simple (obviously). Control the left paddle with "w" and "s", and the right paddle with arrow keys "up" and "down".
The round ends when a player reaches 10 points.
As many rounds can be played as wanted.
Support for different numbers of points to win, full matches with sets, etc. will be added in a later release.

Spin can be applied to the ball, though this works in the same way as Pong for the Atari- it is not dependent on the movement of the paddle, but what region of the paddle it hits. The ball will speed up after a number of hits before it reaches terminal velocity.
